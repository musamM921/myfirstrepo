            <strong><h2> What is on Cats by Charles Bukowski about?</h2></strong>
            <p>Cats offers Bukowski's musings on these beloved animals and their toughness and resiliency. <br>He honors them as fighters, hunters, survivors who command awe and respect as they grip tightly onto the world around them:</br> <strong><em>“The more cats you have, the longer you live. If you have a hundred cats, you'll live ten times longer than if you have ten. 
               Someday this will be discovered, and people will have a thousand cats and live forever.”</em></strong></p>
            <p><h2>How many cats did Charles Bukowski have?</h2></p>
            <h3>Nine Cats...</h3>
            Bukowski, who at one point had nine cats:
            <strong><em>“Having a bunch of cats around is good. If you're feeling bad, you just look at the cats, you'll feel better, 
                because they know everything is, just as it is. 
                There's nothing to get excited about</em></strong>
            <strong><em>“The more cats you have, the longer you live. If you have a hundred cats,
                 you'll live ten times longer than if you have ten. 
                Someday this will be discovered, and people will have a thousand cats and live forever.”</em></strong>

                <br>Henry Charles Bukowski  (August 16, 1920 – March 9, 1994) was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer. His writing was influenced by the social, cultural, and economic ambience of his adopted home city of Los Angeles. Bukowski's work addresses the ordinary lives of poor Americans, the act of writing, alcohol, relationships with women, and the drudgery of work. The FBI kept a file on him as a result of his column Notes of a Dirty Old Man in the LA underground newspaper Open City.</br>

                 <p> <br>Bukowski published extensively in small literary magazines and with small presses beginning in the early 1940s and continuing on through the early 1990s. He wrote thousands of poems, hundreds of short stories and six novels, eventually publishing over sixty books during the course of his career. Some of these works include his Poems Written Before Jumping Out of an 8 Story Window, published by his friend and fellow poet Charles Potts, and better known works such as Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame. These poems and stories were later republished by John Martin's Black Sparrow Press (now HarperCollins/Ecco Press) as collected volumes of his work. As noted by one reviewer, "Bukowski continued to be, thanks to his antics and deliberate clownish performances, the king of the underground and the epitome of the littles in the ensuing decades, stressing his loyalty to those small press editors who had first championed his work and consolidating his presence in new ventures such as the New York Quarterly, Chiron Review, or Slipstream."</br></p>
                    
                    In 1986, Time called Bukowski a "laureate of American lowlife". Regarding his enduring popular appeal, Adam Kirsch of The New Yorker wrote, "the secret of Bukowski's appeal ... [is that] he combines the confessional poet's promise of intimacy with the larger-than-life aplomb of a pulp-fiction hero."
                    During his lifetime, Bukowski received little attention from academic critics in the USA, but was better received in Europe, particularly the UK, and especially Germany, where he was born. Since his death in March 1994, Bukowski has been the subject of a number of critical articles and books about both his life and writings.</p>
